          I have always been a gamer since I was a child. I started with games
          such as Mario, Doom and other similar games of the 90s, but when World
          of Warcraft came out, I was addicted. I loved WOW. It was a full-time
          job as I was part of the second-best guild in Oceania at the time. It
          meant that I had to be on top of my game, gathering resources and
          preparations for raids. All that being said, the friends and memories
          I have made could not be replaced by anything.

          Nowadays, I tend to take the chiller side of gaming. As being in a
          constant battle with time, I have the issue of being able to sit down
          to enjoy a nice game, but I have found solace in a new type of game
          called Idle gaming and the king of them all is Idleon. It has all the
          RPG elements I love without having to spend hours a day managing
          resources and opening Excel sheets on improvements. I hope I can
          eventually make my contributions to the world of gaming.
