        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Hamzah Wilson born on July 30th, 1988, in a bustling city
          in China called Changsha. Growing up in Changsha was an adventure; the
          streets were always bustling with people, and the food was always
          delicious. I spent my early childhood exploring the city and making
          friends with other kids in the neighborhood. When I was seven years
          old, my family decided to move to Australia, and I left behind my
          childhood home and all my memories in Changsha. I was excited but
          nervous about this new chapter in my life. Everything was new and
          unfamiliar, but I soon fell in love with Australia, with its beautiful
          beaches, friendly people, and diverse culture. Over the years, I
          embraced the Australian way of life, making new friends, learning the
          language, and experiencing new things. However, even as I built a new
          life in Australia, I never forgot my roots and the city where I was
          born, Changsha.

        <h2>ChangSha</h2>
        <p>
          My favourite place to visit will still always be ChangSha my
          birthplace, as it is embedded with memories of my childhood that I
          cannot forget. Changsha is a city located in central China, the
          capital of Hunan Province. It has a population of over 7 million
          people, making it one of the largest cities in China. Changsha has a
          long history and rich cultural heritage. The city is also known for
          its spicy cuisine, especially the local specialty of Hunan cuisine.
